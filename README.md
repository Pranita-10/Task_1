# Task_1 
# HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
What it is: HTML is the foundational language for creating web pages. It defines the structure and content of a webpage. Think of it as the skeleton or blueprint of your website.

# Key Function:
It uses a series of "tags" (like <p> for a paragraph, <h1> for a heading, <img> for an image) to organize content and create the logical flow of the page.

# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
What it is:  CSS is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It controls how the HTML elements are displayed on the screen.

# Key Function:
It's responsible for the visual appearance of a website. This includes colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, and animations. If HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the skin and clothing.

# JavaScript
What it is: JavaScript is a programming language that enables you to create dynamic and interactive content on a website. It makes a website "do things."

# Key Function:
It handles user interactions, manipulates the HTML and CSS, communicates with servers, and adds behavior that makes a static page feel alive. If HTML is the structure and CSS is the style, JavaScript is the brain.
